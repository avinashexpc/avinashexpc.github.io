		<h2> About India</h2>
		<p>India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress during the last 65 years of its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the <a href="https://himachaltourism.gov.in/great-himalayas/">Great Himalayas</a> in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.</p>
